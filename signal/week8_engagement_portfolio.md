# Signal Corps Week 8 Engagement Portfolio — Kirubel Tewodros

_For interim PDF report submission Tue 2026-04-14, 21:00 UTC._
_Compiled 2026-04-13._

## Summary

Week 8 deliverables focused on establishing Oracle Forge's external technical credibility ahead of the Week 9 DAB benchmark submission. Strategy: ship specific, evidence-linked content grounded in real failure modes from the team's KB, not generic project announcements. Pivot executed mid-week after early broadcasts underperformed (1 like each) — shifted to reply-threading under larger accounts and targeted subreddit engagement.

## Published Content

### Medium Article (1 of 2 SC articles required)
| Date | Title | Link | Length | Status |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 2026-04-10 | Engineering Resilience: Solving the Cross-Database Join Key Format Mismatch in AI Agents | [medium.com](https://medium.com/@kirutew17654321/engineering-resilience-solving-the-cross-database-join-key-format-mismatch-in-ai-agents-ffb17b9d5a02) | 1,200+ words | Published |

**Technical focus:** DAB Requirement 2 (Ill-formatted join keys). Walks through the PostgreSQL `subscriber_id = 1234567` vs MongoDB `"CUST-1234567"` failure mode, how the agent silently returns zero rows with full confidence, and the 6-line `normalize_join_key()` fix now implemented in `agent/utils.py` on `feat/agent`.

**Evidence link:** The article's thesis (join-key normalization as the #1 multi-DB failure mode) is now directly implemented in the agent's runtime code — not hypothetical. The Medium → code link is the cleanest credibility chain we've produced.

### X Threads / Posts (Week 8 minimum: 2; delivered: 3)
| # | Date | Topic | Link |
|---|------|-------|------|
| 1 | 2026-04-09 | PG+MongoDB join-key friction | [x.com](https://x.com/kirubeltewodro2/status/2042250450888503584) |
| 2 | 2026-04-09 | DAB 38% pass@1 ceiling = engineering gap, not model gap | [x.com](https://x.com/kirubeltewodro2/status/2042263948691415485) |
| 3 | 2026-04-10 | Medium article announcement | [x.com](https://x.com/kirubeltewodro2/status/2042676161499570186) |

**Engagement learning:** All three posts received 1 like each. Diagnosis: broadcasting from a small account without larger-account engagement does not compound. Pivot for Week 9: reply-thread under @shipp_ai / @_avichawla / @himanshustwts / @sh_reya / @ashpreetbedi / @0xcgn / DataHub-adjacent posts with value-first technical substance, Oracle Forge as evidence only. **Pivot validated 2026-04-13** when 5 reply-placements landed and one received a verbatim thesis-restatement from @matanzutta (non-coordinated practitioner).

### Reddit Posts & Substantive Comments
| # | Date | Subreddit | Topic | Link | Engagement |

**r/MachineLearning** was blocked due to insufficient karma — pivoted to r/learnmachinelearning. r/LocalLLaMA delivered the highest-value engagement of Week 8.

## Notable Community Response

### u/matt-k-wong — r/LocalLLaMA, 2026-04-11

**What they asked:** "What sized model are you running injection tests on?" followed by a reference to Karpathy's recent wiki/markdown viral take — asking whether structured docs really transfer knowledge better than raw context.

**What we responded:** Clarified our stack (Llama 3.3 70B via Groq for initial tests; later switched to `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for faster iteration). Confirmed our finding that structured/tabular KB documents achieve higher information density than prose and that this effect is model-size-agnostic.

**Confirmation received:** u/matt-k-wong validated "longer docs = lower quality" as a general property and linked our approach to Karpathy's thesis — external validation that our KB format choices are on the right track.

**Impact on build:** Reinforced Mikias's decision to keep KB docs short, table-heavy, and Q&A-anchored. The 21/21 injection test pass rate achieved on 2026-04-12 on llama-3.1-8b-instant is a direct outcome of this approach.

### @matanzutta — X, 2026-04-13

**Context:** Kirubel reply-threaded the "Domain Knowledge Trap" tweet (churn rate definition example) under @ashpreetbedi's Dash v2 thread (a paid AI data-agent product whose post said "text-to-SQL agents fail because schemas...").

**What @matanzutta replied:** *"the gap between what the schema says and what the business actually means is where most agent queries go wrong"*

**Why this matters:** A non-coordinated practitioner outside the cohort, outside the team, restated our Domain Knowledge thesis verbatim. This is the highest-signal external validation in the portfolio: it confirms the framing transfers to industry practitioners and lands without any push from us.

## Intelligence Impact on Team Build

| Source | Insight | How It Changed Our Approach |
|--------|---------|----------------------------|
| u/matt-k-wong (r/LocalLLaMA) | Structured docs > raw context length for knowledge transfer | Validated keeping KB docs table-anchored and Q&A-testable; Mikias's 21/21 injection test harness is built on this principle |
| @matanzutta (X) | Non-coordinated practitioner restatement of Domain Knowledge thesis | Confirms the framing translates beyond the cohort — informs Week 9 X content positioning toward "schema-business gap" terminology |
| Practitioner Manual + DAB official channels | "DAB community if accessible" hedge — verified no DAB Discord exists | Redirected community engagement to Hugging Face, EleutherAI, LlamaIndex Discords (all on-topic for data agents) |
| Karpathy LLM wiki thesis | Compressed info outperforms raw context in LLMs | Drove final KB format decision — markdown tables + targeted Q&A per document |
