## Trace Schema (every tool call)

```json
{
  "query_id": "dab_yelp_003",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-10T14:32:01Z",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,

  "final_answer": "high-value segment",
  "pass@1": true,
  "confidence": 0.92
}

## Scoring

**pass@1 = (correct first answers) / (total queries)**
